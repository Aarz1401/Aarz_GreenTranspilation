To assess whether the model's knowledge cut-off affects the magnitude of performance gains, we compared energy savings and runtime speedups between benchmarks published before and after the cut-off, using identical pairing and aggregation strategies as in RQ2. For energy, the median saving was 97.1% (95% CI [96.6%, 97.4%]) in the 'Before' group, and 97.5% (95% CI [96.9%, 97.9%]) in the 'After' group. For runtime, the median speedup was 96.7% (95% CI [96.0%, 96.9%]) versus 97.0% (95% CI [96.0%, 97.2%]). Mann–Whitney U tests found no evidence of a difference in energy savings (p = 0.0838) and no evidence of a difference in runtime speedup (p = 0.124).
