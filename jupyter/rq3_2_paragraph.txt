To assess whether the model's knowledge cut-off affects the magnitude of performance gains, we compared energy savings and runtime speedups between benchmarks published before and after the cut-off, using identical pairing and aggregation strategies as in RQ2. For energy, the median saving was 93.8% (95% CI [92.3%, 94.9%]) in the 'Before' group, and 93.0% (95% CI [91.6%, 95.3%]) in the 'After' group. For runtime, the median speedup was 93.7% (95% CI [92.4%, 95.2%]) versus 93.4% (95% CI [91.6%, 95.3%]). Mann–Whitney U tests found no evidence of a difference in energy savings (p = 0.712) and no evidence of a difference in runtime speedup (p = 0.73).
